									<h3>Introduction</h3>
									<p> 
										Main objective of this lab was to compare different approximation methods to
										solve for transonic flow. These methods involved TSDE, Prandtl-Glauert and
										incompressible assumptions. We were provided data for TSDE and incompressible
										data. To solve using the Prandtl-Glauert method we used the jacobi method to iterate
										the velocities at different points on the grid. To ensure that the velocities values
										converged we chose our max error to be below 1*10^-6. To fully define the grid we
										used boundary conditions. For left and right and top edges we just assumed that the
										velocities are the same as the velocities two points from it. We can assume this since
										the flow is undisturbed at those points. For the bottom part we can only make this
										assumption when the flow is not in the airfoil. When the flow is in the airfoil we have
										to use œÜ ùëñ,3 ‚àí 2‚àÜùëßùëß'. Now that the flow is fully defined inside the grid we can do data
										analysis and work out the Cp values around the airfoil. The result we got shows that
										for M = 0.3 where the flow is subsonic all 3 methods have very similar output. But
										when we reach the transonic domain M = 0.85 the Cp values start to differ. This is
										because at 0.85 there is a shock wave located on the airfoil surface. Cd values are very
										low, almost zero for M = 0.3 because the airfoil is at zero degrees angle of attack and
										this can be seen from all the methods. For M = 0.85 the drag is almost zero until the
										point where a shock wave occurs in the airfoil. Then we have some significant Cd
										values. This can only be seen from TSDE since that is the only method that accounts
										for shock waves. In conclusion the TSDE equation is the closest to real life flow. This
										is because it accounts for the shock waves. Prandlt-Glauert overshoots the Cp values
										but is still reliable to just see a rough estimate of the flow. Incompressible predicts the
										worst at high or transonic speeds.

										<p>From figure 1 we can see how the grid is setup whil doing CFD. Also how the boundary conditions are used to fully define the grid.
											Simulating the subsonic small disturbance equation is a crucial endeavor in aerodynamics, offering deep
											insights into the behavior of airflow around airfoils at subsonic speeds. By solving this equation, engineers gain a
											comprehensive understanding of lift generation, flow patterns, and the distribution of pressure around airfoils. This
											understanding facilitates the prediction of aerodynamic forces such as lift and drag, essential for designing efficient
											and stable aircraft. Moreover, simulations enable the optimization of airfoil shapes to achieve desired performance
											metrics, while also serving as a means to validate experimental data and explore various design trade-offs. As both
											an educational tool and a platform for advanced research, simulations of the subsonic small disturbance equation
											play a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of aerodynamics and driving innovation in aircraft design

									<p>From figure 2 we can see that the first part of the code fully defines the grid point in MATLAB. Then after the grid is fully define I used Jacobi method to work out the velocity at each pont in the grid. Then using those velocity values I worked out the Cd and Cp values.</p>

									<h6> Figure 3 (Cp distribution for thr airfoil at 0.3 mach number)</h6>		
									<p> From figure 3 we can see that the Cp distribution for M = 0.3 is almost the same from all the methods. This
										is because at M = 0.3 the flow stays subsonic throughout the end and no shock waves happen on the airfoil surface.
										Subsonic code and TSDE code both result in almost the same Cp on the airfoil.
										Also from the graph we can see that the incompressible graph looks very similar to the subsonic code
										graph. This is because when the speed is very low like in this case the flow can be assumed to be incompressible.
										This is why subsonic also gives almost the same result as subsonic code.
										To sum it up, for a low speed flow we can assume incompressibility and work with linear flow to get very
										accurate results with much less work</p>

									<h6> Figure 4 (Cp distribution for thr airfoil at 0.85 mach number)</h6>	
									<p> Figure 4 shows how Cp distribution varies over the airfoil for all the methods. From the graph we can see
										that there are many variations here. Unlike for M = 0.3 where the graphs were almost identical. From comparing
										figure 2 and 3 we can see that the incompressible data is almost the same for both mach numbers. We know that this
										should not be the case. For subsonic code the graph takes the same shape in both the cases but for M = 0.85 the Cp
										values are a lot higher since max Cp for M = 0.3 was around 0.3 but for M = 0.85 it's about 0.55.
										Graph that changed the most from figure 3 to 4 is the TSDE graph. Main reason for this is because TSDE
										code accounts for shock waves. We know from theory that the flow reaches M = 1 on the airfoil somewhere for this
										case. When the flow reaches M = 1 a shock wave occurs on the surface of the airfoil. Pressure drops drastically after
										a shock wave. Hence that is why we see e drop in the Cp value from X = 0.66 to 0.68.
										From all these observations we can conclude that the best numerical method to solve for transonic flow is
										TSDE since this is the only method that accounts for the shock waves which are a crucial part of transonic flow.
										Figure 3 and 4 are generated using the MATLAB code attached in the appendix. Prandtl-Glauert data was
										generated using the CFD code but TSDE and incompressible data were given to us..</p>

									<h6> Figure 5 (Cd  values using all 3 methods.)</h6>		
									<p> From figure 5 we can see that the Cd values from all the methods for both the mach numbers are almost
										zero. One reason for this is that the airfoil is symmetric and at 0 degrees angle of attack. From theory we know that
										this will produce no lift. Also no drag since we assumed inviscid flow so skin friction drag is removed. Leaving us
										with only one kind of drag which is wave drag. TSDE is the only method that accounts for shock waves. Hence This
										is why the Cd values for TSDE are not very very small. The only significant Cd value is for TSDE M = 0.85. This is
										due to the shock wave occurring on the airfoil. This can also be proved using D'alembert's principle. Which states
										that if an object is immersed in a fluid stream and is unbounded in every direction then the net parallel force exerted
										by the inviscid flow will always be zero</p>

										<h3>Conclusion</h3>		
										<p>  In conclusion we can say to solve transonic flow and get the full picture of what is going on on each point
											of the airfoil we have to use TSDE code. Prandtl-Glauert can only give us a very rough estimate on what the Cp
											looks like on the airfoil. Incompressible tells us nothing about the transonic flow abilities. Therefore if precise data
											is needed then TSDE should be used otherwise for rough data Prandtl-Glauert can work. For low speed flow
											incompressible assumption is the best method since it gives out the solution very fast and it is pretty accurate.</p>
										<p>Intelligent insights gleaned from modeling or numerical experiments are invaluable for understanding
											complex systems and informing decision-making processes across various domains. These insights encompass
											predicting unobservable phenomena, exploring parametric sensitivity, understanding emergent properties,
											quantifying uncertainty and risk, validating and calibrating models, and gaining insights into complex dynamics.
											Through numerical simulations, researchers can predict intricate behaviors, uncover hidden patterns, and explore the
											effects of changing parameters or conditions on system behavior. Moreover, simulations enable the study of
											emergent properties arising from interactions between components, providing crucial insights into system-level
											behavior. By quantifying uncertainty and risk, researchers can assess the reliability of model predictions and make
											informed decisions in the face of uncertainty. Additionally, numerical experiments play a key role in validating
											models against empirical data, refining model parameters, and improving predictive accuracy. Ultimately, these
											intelligent insights drive innovation, support evidence-based decision-making, and enhance our understanding of
											complex systems, fostering progress and sustainability in diverse fields.</p>
